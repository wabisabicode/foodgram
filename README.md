## CI/CD

The project is built from four containers:
backend, frontend, postgresql, nginx.

Automatic testing is included when commits are added to the main project branch, along with deployment to the server. You can find more details on the project's [GitHub](https://github.com/wabisabicode/foodgram).

## Local Deployment

Developers can deploy the project locally. To do this, navigate to the `infra` directory and run docker compose:

```
cd infra && sudo docker compose up --build -d
```

The project will be available at the local address [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1)

For a successful launch, you need a `backend/.env` file. Here is a template for the file:

```
# secret key for Django
SECRET_KEY=
# debug mode True/False
DEBUG_MODE=
# database name
POSTGRES_DB=
# DB username
POSTGRES_USER=
# DB user password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
# DB hostname - must match the DB service name in docker-compose.yml
DB_HOST=
# DB connection port
DB_PORT=5432
```

After the containers have started successfully, you need to manually run Django migrations and collect static files in the `backend` container.

```
sudo docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
sudo docker compose exec backend python manage.py collectstatic
sudo docker compose exec backend cp -r /app/foodgram_backend/collected_static/. /backend_static/static/
```

After this, the project is ready for local work and testing.
